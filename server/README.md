# vocaphone gateway

The gateway accepts bounded recordings from the vocaphone iPhone and Android
apps, normalizes them with FFmpeg, invokes a local speech engine, and returns an
idempotent transcript. It includes an authenticated HTMX WebUI for setup, model
management, engine selection, microphone testing, and operational status.

## Deployment summary

| Mode | Engines | Recommended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native macOS | MLX Audio, WhisperKit, VocaMac, Handy, sherpa-onnx, `whisper.cpp` | Best performance on Apple silicon |
| Native Linux | sherpa-onnx INT8, faster-whisper, Moonshine, optional `whisper.cpp` | Linux desktop or home server without Docker |
| Docker Compose | sherpa-onnx INT8, faster-whisper INT8, Moonshine, `whisper.cpp` | Reproducible Linux `amd64`/`arm64` images |

Native MLX Audio and WhisperKit are the accelerated choices on Apple silicon.
Docker Desktop runs the portable Linux image in a VM, so it cannot use the
macOS MLX/WhisperKit/Core ML paths. See [deployment.md](../docs/deployment.md) for the
performance explanation, operational commands, and persistence details.

## Native macOS quick start

Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), Python 3.12+, and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Install the host dependencies first:

- `ffmpeg` — audio normalization (required by every engine)
- `whisperkit-cli` — WhisperKit/Core ML engine on Apple silicon, and the engine
  behind the VocaMac adapter
- `whisper-cpp` — provides `whisper-cli` for GGML `whisper.cpp` models,
  including the Handy model family, which runs without the Handy app

The [VocaMac](https://github.com/VocaHQ/vocamac) and
[Handy](https://handy.computer) desktop apps are **optional and Mac-only**:
VocaMac needs an Apple silicon Mac, Handy needs macOS. Install neither and the
gateway downloads and runs its own models; install either and the gateway can
reuse the models that app already downloaded instead of asking for a second
copy. On Linux and in containers both engines are hidden from the WebUI picker,
and selecting one through the API is rejected with `422 invalid_engine`.

```sh
brew install ffmpeg whisperkit-cli whisper-cpp
cd server
uv sync --all-groups --extra engines --extra apple
uv run vocaphone-server
```

The first run creates `~/.config/vocaphone/token` with mode `600`. Open
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, enter the token, download a recommended model, select
it, and confirm the Overview shows **Ready for dictation**.

To keep the gateway running after terminal sessions and restart it after login:

```sh
./scripts/install-launch-agent.sh
```

The LaunchAgent uses the checkout's `.venv`, adds standard Homebrew paths, and
writes logs to `~/Library/Logs/Vocaphone/`.

MLX Audio and WhisperKit are recommended on Apple silicon. The `apple` extra
installs MLX only on an arm64 Mac; it is deliberately absent from Linux and
Docker. The standalone `whisper.cpp` engine uses the `whisper-cli` binary
installed above (override its location with `VOCAPHONE_WHISPER_BINARY`); on a
native Linux host it is optional and can be built from source instead.

## Native Linux quick start

Requires Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and FFmpeg on the host.

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg
# Install uv if needed: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

cd server
uv sync --all-groups --extra engines
uv run vocaphone-server
```

Do not pass `--extra apple` on Linux. The first run creates
`~/.config/vocaphone/token` with mode `600`. The banner prints the WebUI URL and
token path; show the secret with `cat ~/.config/vocaphone/token`. Open
`http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, enter the token, download a recommended model
(SenseVoice Small INT8 or Parakeet TDT INT8 on CPU), select it, and confirm
**Ready for dictation**.

To keep the gateway running after the terminal closes:

```sh
./scripts/install-systemd-user.sh
# optional: keep the user session (and unit) after logout
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

```sh
systemctl --user status com.vocahq.vocaphone.gateway.service
journalctl --user -u com.vocahq.vocaphone.gateway.service -f
```

The unit uses the checkout's `.venv`. Re-run the installer after moving the
repository or recreating the virtualenv.

Phone clients on the same LAN can use `http://<host-lan-ip>:8765` while the
gateway binds `0.0.0.0` (the default). For Tailscale Serve only, bind loopback:

```sh
VOCAPHONE_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1 uv run vocaphone-server
```

### Phone pairing QR

After you authenticate in the WebUI, the Overview page shows a **Pair phone app**
QR. The iPhone and Android apps scan it to fill the gateway URL and bearer token.
The code encodes a versioned JSON payload:

```json
{"v":1,"url":"http://192.168.1.20:8765","token":"..."}
```

Discovery prefers private Wi‑Fi addresses (for example `192.168.x.x`). Override
with `VOCAPHONE_PUBLIC_URL` or `VOCAPHONE_PAIRING_URL` when automatic selection
is wrong. The QR is only available through the authenticated WebUI/API.

The same card can create a named per-device token and immediately show its own
QR instead of the shared bootstrap token, and a **Token to encode** dropdown
switches which one the QR (and the `/v1/admin/pairing` and
`/v1/admin/pairing/qr.svg` JSON/SVG endpoints, via `?token_id=`) currently
encodes. A device token's plaintext is cached in memory only for the life of
the gateway process — long enough to regenerate its QR at a different address
without creating a duplicate — and is dropped immediately on revoke.

## Docker Compose quick start

[compose.yaml](compose.yaml) is the canonical container deployment. It builds a
non-root Linux image containing FFmpeg, the gateway, and a pinned `whisper.cpp`
CLI. The same Dockerfile builds on Linux `amd64` and `arm64`.

```sh
cd server
umask 077
printf 'VOCAPHONE_TOKEN=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
printf 'VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_HOST=127.0.0.1\n' >> .env
printf 'VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_PORT=8765\n' >> .env
docker compose up --detach --build
docker compose ps
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8765/health/live
```

The token is provided as a Compose secret rather than a container environment
variable. Models, configuration, and the SQLite database persist in the
`vocaphone_vocaphone-data` named volume mounted at `/data`.

The container is live before a model is installed, so `/health/ready` initially
returns `503`. Open the WebUI, enter the token from `.env`, download/select a
recommended sherpa-onnx, Moonshine, or faster-whisper model, and check again:

```sh
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8765/health/ready
```

The default Compose publication is host loopback only. This is appropriate for
Tailscale Serve. To intentionally allow direct LAN access, set
`VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` and protect the port with the host
firewall. Never expose port 8765 to the public internet.

The default bridge network also hides the host's real LAN address from the
gateway's own address auto-discovery (used for the pairing QR): the container
only ever sees its private bridge IP, not the host's Wi-Fi/Ethernet interface.
On Linux Docker Engine (not Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows), set
`VOCAPHONE_NETWORK_MODE=host` in `.env` instead so the container shares the
host's network namespace and discovery finds the real `192.168.x.x` address.
This ignores `VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_HOST`/`PORT` — the container binds directly on
the host per `VOCAPHONE_BIND_HOST`/`VOCAPHONE_PORT`, so lock down port 8765
with the host firewall first.

## WebUI

The authenticated WebUI provides:

- dependency, storage, model, and engine setup checks
- process uptime, active/queued work, outcomes, rejections, and stage-level latency
- detected CPU allocation/features, container state, and available accelerators
- hardware-aware model recommendations and disk-size/RAM guidance
- background downloads with scoped progress polling and cancellation
- model selection/deletion and persistent engine settings
- custom `.bin`/`.gguf` model downloads from HTTPS URLs
- one-run or three-run microphone benchmarks with normalization, model-load,
  inference, real-time-factor, and peak-memory results
- selected engine/model and readiness/warmup status
- a redacted diagnostics export for bug reports (Settings tab or
  `uv run vocaphone-diagnostics`); never includes the token, audio, transcripts,
  or session identifiers
- named, independently revocable per-device tokens (Settings tab), so losing
  one phone means revoking that device's token instead of rotating everyone
  else's; the bootstrap `VOCAPHONE_TOKEN` always keeps working alongside them

Operational counters stay in process memory, contain no audio or transcript
content, and reset when the gateway process restarts.

The catalog contains WhisperKit Core ML and MLX models for Apple silicon,
portable sherpa-onnx INT8 models, persistent CTranslate2 `faster-whisper`
models, Moonshine models for Arabic, English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean,
Mandarin Chinese, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese, and portable `whisper.cpp` models.
It also includes compact Whisper Medium,
Whisper Large v3, and Breeze ASR builds from
[Handy's documented model family](https://handy.computer/docs/models) that run
directly through `whisper.cpp`; Handy does not need to be installed.
SenseVoice, Parakeet, GigaAM, Canary, Dolphin, and Qwen3-ASR now all run independently of Handy through sherpa-onnx;
Parakeet, Qwen3-ASR, and Granite Speech also have Apple-native MLX options.
GigaAM (Russian, CTC or RNNT) and Canary (English only in this build; the
underlying model also covers German, French, and Spanish, but source/target
language is fixed when the recognizer loads rather than per request) download
individual files directly from their Hugging Face model repos rather than a
packaged archive, since neither publishes one.

Qwen3-ASR reads a Hugging Face tokenizer
directory instead of a `tokens.txt`, so the gateway fetches `tokenizer/` and
passes the folder to the recognizer.

Parakeet ships in two generations, and newer is not automatically better: v3
covers 25 European languages, while the English-only v2 spends all of its
capacity on English and transcribes it more accurately. Pick v2 if you dictate
only in English.

### Fast model guide

| Model | Best host | Download | Languages | Choose it when |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| SenseVoice Small INT8 | Linux or macOS CPU | ~240 MB | Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Japanese, Korean | Lowest portable latency and small-server memory use matter most |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 INT8 | Linux or macOS CPU | ~672 MB | 25 European languages | You want stronger multilingual accuracy, punctuation, and capitalization |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B v2 INT8 | Linux or macOS CPU | ~661 MB | English only | You dictate only in English and want the best accuracy at that speed |
| Dolphin Small CTC INT8 | Linux or macOS CPU | ~250 MB | 40 Eastern languages | You need Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Urdu, Thai, or another South or Southeast Asian language |
| MLX Whisper Large v3 Turbo 4-bit | Apple silicon | ~469 MB | Multilingual | You want compact high accuracy through the M-series GPU |
| MLX Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 | Apple silicon with at least 8 GB RAM | ~2.51 GB | 25 European languages | You want the full MLX Parakeet path and have enough unified memory |
| MLX Qwen3-ASR 0.6B 4-bit | Apple silicon with at least 8 GB RAM | ~713 MB | 11 languages | You want strong punctuation from an LLM decoder and can accept slower decoding |
| MLX Granite Speech 4.1 2B | Apple silicon with at least 12 GB RAM | ~2.38 GB | English only | You want top-ranked English accuracy on Apple silicon |

Every adapter keeps its loaded model in the gateway process. Benchmark three
runs in the Test tab: the first includes model load, while runs two and three
show steady-state dictation speed. SenseVoice uses the FunASR Model License;
both Parakeet variants use CC BY 4.0; the quantized MLX Whisper model inherits
Whisper's MIT license; Dolphin, Qwen3-ASR, and Granite Speech are Apache 2.0.
Review the license shown on each model card before
redistributing weights.

## Engine selection

The `auto` engine preference uses the first runnable option in this order:

1. VocaMac when the app is installed and one of its downloaded Core ML models
   is complete
2. Handy when its macOS application binary is present
3. a downloaded WhisperKit model kept resident in a managed loopback service
4. a downloaded MLX Audio model on Apple silicon
5. a downloaded sherpa-onnx model
6. a downloaded `faster-whisper` model kept resident in the gateway process
7. a downloaded/configured `whisper.cpp` model

Steps 1 and 2 are skipped on any machine without those optional apps, which is
every Linux host and every container.

On a CPU-only Linux host, start with SenseVoice Small INT8 when its five
languages cover your use case, or Parakeet TDT INT8 for its 25 European
languages. Keep faster-whisper Base as the broad Whisper fallback. Compute
device and precision settings affect faster-whisper; sherpa models are already
INT8 CPU exports. Use the Test tab's three-run benchmark after the first warm
run.

Moonshine's English Medium, Small, and Tiny Streaming tiers, and the sherpa-onnx
Streaming Zipformer English 20M INT8 model, accept float32 PCM over an
authenticated WebSocket while the iPhone records — real incremental decoding
with partial results, not a periodic re-transcription of the growing buffer.
Moonshine Medium favors accuracy, Small is the balanced Linux default, and Tiny
favors latency; the Zipformer model favors speed over accuracy at a fraction of
the download size. The ordinary WAV is still retained during the request and
automatically used by the batch API if streaming is unavailable or interrupted.
Streaming support is negotiated on that socket to avoid an extra network round
trip before every recording.

Every other model — the remaining Moonshine tiers, WhisperKit, faster-whisper,
and every other sherpa-onnx model above — uses its fast batch path after
recording. The server returns a structured unsupported response for those, so
the app immediately continues through the ordinary upload pipeline. In the
iPhone app or keyboard, **Automatic** uses the active gateway model. Choosing a
named language requires the active model to support that same language.

Moonshine's English code and weights use the MIT license. Its non-English weights
use the Moonshine Community License and are limited to non-commercial use; the
WebUI labels these models **personal use**. Review the current
[Moonshine licensing and model documentation](https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine)
before deploying them outside a personal setup.

The WebUI can explicitly select an engine or installed model and persists that
choice in the runtime configuration file.

Four engines need a specific host, and the WebUI names the requirement next to
each one:

| Engine | Runs on |
| --- | --- |
| `vocamac` | Apple silicon Macs (the VocaMac app is Apple-silicon-only) |
| `mlx-audio` | Apple silicon Macs |
| `handy` | macOS |
| `whisperkit` | macOS |

The engine picker lists them only on a host that can run them, and both the
WebUI and `PUT /v1/admin/config` reject a selection the host cannot run with
`422 invalid_engine` rather than persisting a broken choice. `auto` skips them
on every other host.

On Apple silicon, current WhisperKit CLIs expose a local `serve` mode. vocaphone
starts it on a random `127.0.0.1` port during warmup and reuses the loaded
Core ML model. If an older CLI does not support `serve`, transcription falls
back to the compatible one-shot command rather than becoming unavailable.

VocaMac has no headless transcription command, so its adapter reuses the app's
Core ML model library and tokenizers through `whisperkit-cli` rather than the
app itself: it reads the model chosen in VocaMac's Models tab, verifies the
downloaded files are complete, and skips partial downloads in favour of another
complete model. VocaMac does not need to be running.

To force VocaMac from the environment:

```sh
export VOCAPHONE_ENGINE=vocamac
export VOCAPHONE_VOCAMAC_MODEL='small'   # optional; otherwise VocaMac's own choice
uv run vocaphone-server
```

`VOCAPHONE_VOCAMAC_MODEL` accepts either a VocaMac model size (`small`,
`large-v3-v20240930_turbo_632MB`) or a WhisperKit folder name
(`openai_whisper-small`). A configured model is never substituted: if it is not
downloaded, the engine reports unavailable rather than quietly using another.

To force Handy from the environment:

```sh
export VOCAPHONE_ENGINE=handy
export VOCAPHONE_HANDY_MODEL='owner/repository/model.gguf'
export VOCAPHONE_HANDY_FALLBACK_MODEL='owner/repository/fallback-model.gguf'
uv run vocaphone-server
```

To force standalone `whisper.cpp`:

```sh
export VOCAPHONE_ENGINE=whisper.cpp
export VOCAPHONE_WHISPER_BINARY=/absolute/path/to/whisper-cli
export VOCAPHONE_WHISPER_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/ggml-model.bin
uv run vocaphone-server
```

## Configuration

Compose-specific variables live in `server/.env`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Host interface published by Docker |
| `VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_PORT` | `8765` | Host port published by Docker |
| `VOCAPHONE_NETWORK_MODE` | `bridge` | Set to `host` on Linux Docker Engine to share the host's network namespace (ignores `VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_HOST`/`PORT`); not supported by Docker Desktop |
| `VOCAPHONE_IMAGE` | `vocaphone-gateway:local` | Local or registry image tag |

Use [`.env.example`](.env.example) as a template and never commit the populated
`.env` file.

## Listener and network access

The native default listener is `0.0.0.0:8765`; the startup banner and WebUI show
that listener separately from the local browser URL. An all-interface listener
is reachable from connected networks, so keep the host firewall enabled.

The iPhone and Android apps accept ordinary HTTP and HTTPS gateway URLs; a
Tailscale hostname is not mandatory. Supported arrangements include:

- a trusted LAN hostname such as `http://homelabone:8765/`; for Docker, set
  `VOCAPHONE_PUBLISH_HOST=0.0.0.0` and protect the port with the host firewall
- a loopback listener exposed privately through Tailscale Serve
- a VPS loopback listener behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and trusted certificate

HTTP does not encrypt the bearer token or recording. Use it only on a trusted
LAN or encrypted VPN, never over the public internet.

For the smallest private exposure, bind/publish on host loopback and use
Tailscale Serve:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg 8765
tailscale serve status
```

Use the reported private HTTPS URL in the iPhone or Android app. Do not use
Funnel. See [deployment.md](../docs/deployment.md) for LAN/VPS alternatives and
[tailscale.md](../docs/tailscale.md) for the private Serve setup.

## Health and readiness

- `GET /health/live` reports HTTP-process liveness and uptime without probing the
  selected engine.
- `GET /health/ready` returns `200` only when the engine/model can transcribe and
  returns `503` otherwise.
- `GET /health` is the backward-compatible iPhone health response and includes
  `streaming_supported` for status display and capability discovery. The iOS
  recording path negotiates on the socket itself to avoid a separate preflight.
- Authenticated `/v1/admin/status` exposes setup, metrics, and readiness details
  used by the WebUI.

Engine probes are cached for five seconds. sherpa-onnx, MLX Audio,
`faster-whisper`, and Moonshine load their selected model once and keep it
resident. WhisperKit warmup starts its managed loopback service and keeps the
Core ML model resident there, and the VocaMac adapter inherits that behavior for
VocaMac's own models. Handy and `whisper.cpp` retain the filesystem-prefetch
warmup behavior.

## Docker performance profiles

Only run one gateway service at a time; every profile publishes the same port
and shares the same model volume.

```sh
# Portable CPU + OpenBLAS (default; amd64 and arm64)
docker compose up --detach --build gateway

# Build CPU kernels for this exact host (fastest CPU image, not portable)
docker compose --profile native up --detach --build gateway-native

# NVIDIA host with Container Toolkit
docker compose --profile cuda up --detach --build gateway-cuda

# Intel/AMD Vulkan device exposed as /dev/dri
docker compose --profile vulkan up --detach --build gateway-vulkan
```

The CUDA profile supports both faster-whisper CUDA and the CUDA `whisper.cpp`
binary. The Vulkan profile accelerates `whisper.cpp`; faster-whisper remains on
CPU there. The dashboard reports what devices the container can actually see.

## CLI and routine operations

```sh
# Query the local backward-compatible health response
uv run vocaphone-status

# Download a redacted diagnostics bundle for a bug report
uv run vocaphone-diagnostics

# Remove sessions older than the configured retention window
uv run vocaphone-cleanup

# Follow the native macOS LaunchAgent logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Vocaphone/gateway.log

# Follow the native Linux systemd user unit logs
journalctl --user -u com.vocahq.vocaphone.gateway.service -f

# Follow container logs
docker compose logs --follow gateway

# Recreate a container from the current checkout
docker compose up --detach --build

# Stop containers but retain the named data volume
docker compose down
```

Do not run `docker compose down --volumes` unless deleting every downloaded
model, configuration file, and stored session is intentional.

## Development checks

```sh
# On macOS add --extra apple when you need MLX / WhisperKit in the dev environment.
uv sync --all-groups --extra engines
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy app
uv run pytest
VOCAPHONE_TOKEN=test-token-with-at-least-thirty-two-characters docker compose config --quiet
docker build --tag vocaphone-gateway:test .
```

Build and publish one tag for both supported Linux architectures from the
repository root:

```sh
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --tag ghcr.io/your-user/vocaphone-gateway:latest \
  --push server
```
