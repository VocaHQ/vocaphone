"""Synthesize the audio the on-device model tests transcribe.

Nothing here is a recording of a person, and nothing is checked in: macOS `say`
speaks a fixed script, `afconvert` turns it into the 16 kHz mono float32 WAV the
app captures, and each scenario then reshapes that audio the way a real
dictation goes wrong -- quiet for its first half, a long pause, silence. The
tests assert on the distinctive words each sentence carries rather than on exact
text, so a different voice or a model that punctuates differently still passes.

    tools/model-e2e/make_scenarios.py ios/build/model-e2e/scenarios

Writes one WAV per scenario and `scenarios.json` beside them. macOS only.
