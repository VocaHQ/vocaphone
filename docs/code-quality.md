# Code quality and performance checks

VocaPhone uses fast static checks on every relevant pull request and keeps
performance measurements separate from correctness tests. Run the platform
gate for the files you changed:

```bash
just android ci       # Android build, tests, lint, and schema/page checks
just ios ci           # iOS project, build, preview, and test checks
git diff --check
```

The Android workflow additionally runs the pinned Detekt CLI with a checked-in
baseline; new warnings fail the job while existing findings remain recorded in
the baseline for gradual cleanup. The iOS workflow does the same with
SwiftLint. SwiftLint baselines are expanded to absolute paths in the runner
workspace by
`tools/prepare-swiftlint-baseline.py`, which keeps the checked-in baseline
portable across local paths and GitHub Actions.

## Measuring the hot path

The existing Android recipe produces both host-JVM and connected-device
measurements:

```bash
just android keyboard-benchmark 2>&1 | tee android/build/keyboard-benchmark.log
```

The benchmark tests emit `VocaPhoneBenchmark|...` records. Capture the output
to a file and compare it with a baseline when a fixed device and workload are
available:

```bash
python3 tools/compare-benchmark.py \
  --input android/build/keyboard-benchmark.log \
  --baseline tools/benchmarks/android-keyboard.json
```

Create or intentionally refresh a baseline with `--write-baseline`. The
comparator defaults to a 15% regression budget and also requires the absolute
threshold supplied by `--max-regression-absolute` to be exceeded. It reports
missing markers and missing baseline metrics as failures, so a broken
benchmark cannot silently pass.

## Runtime diagnostics

Debug Android builds now enable StrictMode logging before the application
container is created and include LeakCanary. Exercise the app and keyboard with
`adb logcat` attached; these checks are deliberately debug-only and do not
change release or F-Droid production artifacts.

iOS tests now include `TypingPerformanceTests`, which records XCTest clock, CPU,
and memory metrics for candidate ranking and word-list completion. Establish
baselines on the simulator or representative phone in Xcode; the hosted
quality job records measurements but does not turn noisy runner timings into a
hard threshold.

Do not check in a benchmark baseline until it comes from a documented device,
OS, model, and workload. Emulator or hosted-runner timings are useful for
trend investigation, but they are not a substitute for a representative
physical-device measurement. Use Perfetto or Android Studio system tracing for
an unexplained Android regression, and Instruments/XCTest metrics for iOS
investigation; those traces remain artifacts of the investigation rather than
release-time source files.
