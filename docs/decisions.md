# Decisions and open setup choices

## Final naming decisions (v0.3.0)

The **Local Flow** working name has been replaced with **vocaphone** across all
identifiers. The following are the final identifiers in use:

| Scope | Final identifier |
| --- | --- |
| Product / display | **vocaphone** (lowercase prose) |
| Client code symbols | **VocaPhone** (PascalCase) |
| Server CLI entry points | `vocaphone-server`, `vocaphone-status`, `vocaphone-diagnostics`, `vocaphone-cleanup` |
| Server env prefix | `VOCAPHONE_` |
| Server config/data paths | `~/.config/vocaphone/`, `~/.local/share/vocaphone/` |
| macOS logs | `~/Library/Logs/Vocaphone/` |
| iOS app bundle ID | `com.vocahq.vocaphone` |
| iOS keyboard bundle ID | `com.vocahq.vocaphone.keyboard` |
| iOS Live Activity bundle ID | `com.vocahq.vocaphone.liveactivity` |
| iOS App Group | `group.com.vocahq.vocaphone` |
| iOS URL scheme | `vocaphone://dictate` |
| Android application ID | `com.vocahq.vocaphone` |
| LaunchAgent label | `com.vocahq.vocaphone.gateway` |
| systemd unit | `com.vocahq.vocaphone.gateway.service` |
| Docker image tag | `vocaphone-gateway` |
| Docker volume | `vocaphone_vocaphone-data` |

Apple Developer portal registration of these bundle identifiers and App Group
under the existing team is a required follow-up.

## Implemented assumptions

These are changeable implementation defaults, not confirmed product decisions:

| Choice | Current assumption | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum iOS | iOS 17.0 | Supports the chosen SwiftUI and audio APIs |
| Recording | WAV from one persistent `AVAudioEngine` input | Avoids losing background microphone readiness between dictations; FFmpeg normalizes it on the Mac |
| Quick Dictation | Enabled, 10-minute ready window | Reduces app switching while bounding battery and microphone exposure |
| Language | Automatic plus Arabic, English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian, and Vietnamese | Automatic follows the selected gateway model; explicit choices must match it |
| Output mode | Raw | Avoids unconfirmed cleanup by default |
| Audio retention | Delete on success; keep failures 24 hours | Privacy with retry recovery |
| Transcript history | Shared session records only | Full product history remains a later choice |
| Native listener | `0.0.0.0:8765` by default; loopback recommended with Serve | Supports LAN setup while allowing a smaller Tailscale-only exposure |
| Container publication | Host loopback port 8765 by default | Keeps Docker private behind Tailscale Serve unless LAN access is intentional |
| Initial engine | `auto`: VocaMac, Handy, WhisperKit, MLX Audio, sherpa-onnx, faster-whisper, then `whisper.cpp` | Uses what is actually runnable while preserving an explicit WebUI choice; the two optional desktop apps come first because their models are already on disk |
| Docker engines | Portable sherpa-onnx INT8, OpenBLAS `whisper.cpp`, persistent faster-whisper CPU INT8, and multilingual Moonshine | Keeps the default portable across Linux `amd64` and `arm64`; separate native CPU, CUDA, and Vulkan profiles opt into host-specific acceleration |

## Must be confirmed before physical-device acceptance

- Whether iOS 17.0 is the desired minimum
- Mac availability and sleep policy
- Whether mixed Hindi/English should be added through a separate multilingual model
- Default native and container models after representative latency, accuracy,
  memory, and disk benchmarks
- Transcript history policy
- Failed-audio retry window
- Whether local cleanup should remain opt-in
