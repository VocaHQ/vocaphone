/**
 * Where a stored selection goes when the model it names has left the catalog.
 *
 * A model id is persisted verbatim in `local_model_id`, so shrinking the catalog
 * strands everyone who had picked one of the removed rows. Without this they
 * fall through `LocalModelCatalog.find` to null and the app quietly re-derives a
 * first-run recommendation -- which, on a phone that was deliberately running
 * Whisper Medium, means landing on Tiny. The person chose a heavier model on
 * purpose; the migration has to respect that and hand them the nearest thing
 * still shipping, not the smallest.
 *
 * Each entry is a preference *list* rather than one id, because "nearest" has to
 * survive the device: a 4 GB phone on `medium-q5_0` cannot hold the 6 GB
 * `large-v3-turbo-q8_0` that replaces it on quality, so the fallback steps down
 * the surviving ladder instead of off it. [replacementFor] resolves the list
 * against what the device can actually run.
 *
 * Mirrors `RetiredLocalModels.swift`. The two catalogs differ -- whisper.cpp
 * GGML here, Core ML there -- so the tables differ; the rule does not.

     * viable on a phone. Everything therefore lands on the Q8_0 build of the
     * same rung, except the sizes with no surviving rung of their own -- medium
     * and the two full large builds -- which move up to `large-v3-turbo-q8_0`
     * and step down to `small-q8_0` where that will not fit.
