/**
 * Every language a model in the catalog can be asked for. Automatic is pinned
 * first as the default; the rest are alphabetical by [displayName].
 *
 * The list is drawn from what the shipped models actually cover, not from
 * Whisper's full hundred: Parakeet TDT v3's 25 European languages, SenseVoice's
 * East Asian five, the Indic and South East Asian range, and the widely spoken
 * languages Whisper handles well at phone-sized quantizations. A code
 * here is meaningless unless some model can honour it, and the picker greys out
 * the ones the active model does not cover.
 *
 * Odia and Kashmiri are deliberately absent: no Whisper build can be pinned to
 * either, so a row for them could never be honoured by anything the user could
 * switch to.
