/**
 * Where a person is in first-run setup.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from [SetupStep]. A step is a requirement, read live
 * from the system every time the app resumes; a stage is a page. Some pages
 * carry a requirement, and some — a welcome, a choice, a confirmation — carry
 * none. Before this split the page *was* the first unmet requirement, which
 * is why there could be no welcome screen, no skip, and no "keyboard ready"
 * moment: each needs a page that is not a requirement.
 *
 * Page position never grants a requirement. That rule is unchanged: [READY]
 * still reads [SetupStatus.isReadyToDictate], and a skipped [MODEL] leaves
 * its requirement unmet, so READY offers "Review remaining setup" exactly as
 * before.
 *
 * Order follows iOS: the big decision first, the download started early so it
 * overlaps the slow system-settings steps, and the keyboard — the step people
 * most often stall on — last, where a stall costs the least.
