/**
 * Everything that happens to a transcript between the model returning it and
 * the record the keyboard inserts from.
 *
 * One funnel rather than three call sites, because the *order* is load-bearing
 * and was previously only implicit:
 *
 * 1. Sanitize. The later stages capitalize sentences and add terminators, and
 *    doing that to `[BLANK_AUDIO]` only makes it look more like something the
 *    user meant to say.
 * 2. Repair — the one stage allowed to change the words, and only when the user
 *    has left Clean up speech on. It runs before styling because it is what
 *    puts the sentence boundaries *there*: styling capitalizes and terminates
 *    around boundaries, and cannot find one that is missing. Never for `RAW`,
 *    which promises the model's own output.
 * 3. Style — but only for transcripts produced on this device. A gateway has
 *    already applied the writing style the session asked for, and applying it
 *    twice is how "Hello." becomes "Hello.." on one route and not the other.
 * 4. Spoken emoji — after styling, because the styler has to see "emoji" as an
 *    ordinary word to capitalize and terminate around it; before digits,
 *    because the table's keys are words — "hundred emoji" is 💯, and once
 *    digit conversion has made it "100 emoji" there is no key left to find.
 *    Applies whichever route produced the transcript: unlike styling, no
 *    gateway has done it already.
 * 5. Digits — after styling, so sentence capitalization can still see the
 *    first word. Matching snippets are protected so a number-word trigger
 *    still expands literally after digit conversion finishes.
