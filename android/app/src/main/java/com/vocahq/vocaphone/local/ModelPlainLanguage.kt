/**
 * What a model is for, in words someone with no idea what a speech model is can

 *
 * The catalog's names are the upstream ones -- "Parakeet TDT 0.6B", "Canary
 * 180M Flash" -- and they are right to keep for anyone who looks the model up,
 * but on their own they say nothing about which one to download. The picker
 * leads with [title] and [summary] and keeps the upstream name as the small
 * print underneath.
 *
 * The ratings are relative to the rest of this catalog, not measurements:
 * accuracy follows the published numbers quoted beside each catalog entry,
 * speed the arm64 timings recorded there. Nothing here was benchmarked on a
 * phone. Mirrors `ModelPlainLanguage.swift`.
