///
/// * A run of adjacent number words is converted only when the whole run reads
///   as one number. "twenty three" is 23; "six seven" is left alone rather than
///   becoming "6 7" or, worse, "13".
/// * A lone "one" stays a word unless a unit follows it. "no one", "one of
///   them" and "one day I'll get to it" are the common cases, and all three are
///   ruined by a converter that cannot tell a quantity from a pronoun.
/// * Nothing is invented. Ordinals ("first", "twenty-first") and spoken times
///   ("seven thirty") stay as they were said: this turns number words into
///   digits, it does not reformat English.
