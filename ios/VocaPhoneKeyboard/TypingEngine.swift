/// Turns keystrokes into a strip, without ever making a keystroke wait.
///
/// The obvious design puts the checker on a serial background queue. It cannot
/// go there: `UITextChecker` is annotated `NS_SWIFT_UI_ACTOR` in the SDK, a
/// per-class decision of Apple's, and using it off the main actor is
/// unsupported. So the same guarantee — *a keystroke never waits for a
/// candidate* — is met three other ways:
///
/// 1. **Ordering.** Text goes into the document synchronously on touch-up. The
///    computation is enqueued as a separate main-actor task, so it runs after
///    the keystroke has been handled and the frame committed.
/// 2. **Generations.** Every enqueued task carries the generation it was born
///    with. A fast typist enqueues one per key and all but the last bail on
///    their first line, so the checker runs once for the burst rather than once
///    per letter.
/// 3. **Caching.** Prefixes already seen never reach the checker at all, which
///    covers backspacing and re-typing — most of what fast typing actually is.
///
/// If device measurement still finds this too expensive, the fallback is
/// already built: ``TypingWordList`` completes and corrects on its own, in pure
/// Swift that *can* run off the main actor.
